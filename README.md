If you DO want to try this bot, you need a folder called config, with a file called config.go, with the following code:

```go
package config

const Key = "Yoru bot key"
const GuildID = "Your guild ID code"
const LogChannelName = "The channel name where the bot will post logs"
const AppID = "The bot's ID code"
const RFRPostID = "A post that the bot will use to listen for React-For-Roles"
const LearningVoteRequirement = "An int for how many emojis triggers the bot to copy the post to Learning Reources

```
